---2024-08-01 10:28:00.671692---today i feel a little better we'll see how the day goes
---2024-08-01 22:02:12.615306---stop listening
---2024-08-01 22:03:40.688001---today was all right i'm anxious about my job it seems i've been talking shit about co-workers which i don't quite understand and i've been fucking up at work. Their all small things but im worried they add up and the longer i stay their the more worried i am that it reflects poorly on me. its hard to judge though because i fix a lot of mistakes around me from veterns, and i cant tell whether what i am doing is minor or major. i'm not sure what the future holds for me i can't tell whether i'm doing good at my job or if this is par for the course. no one will tell me whether i'm doing a good job they all just told me i'm all right. there is no way to gauge my path. i don't know where the line is. i'm worried what tomorrow holds for me.

---2024-08-03 07:39:12.211098---yesterday was hard i got my first verbal warning i'm fucking up at work it's a lot of little things everybody seems to fuck up little things but i get called out i don't know what it is i don't know if minor major or minor or what it is i clean up plenty of people's mistakes so i know they go on it brings me a lot of stress brings me no joy it makes me not want to work as hard knowing that the fuck up so the potential to do well they also throw a lot more work at me the documentation is getting ridiculous honestly the amount of not taking that i have to do is becoming intrusive to work
---2024-08-06 09:26:48.055909---so i think i got scammed by the ac company yesterday he essentially swapped out my capacitor the last time he was visiting with a dying one and forced me to buy a new one this time that i ended up paying $400 for I would not be so suspicious if the part had not died a week after his last visit which was a preventive maintenance call these bills of adulting are causing me stress and anxiety and i'm having trouble dealing with all of my emotions i'm wondering if i need therapy or my medicines need to be reevaluated if i could just pay off all of my troubles i would be feeling this way but being impoverished makes it hard to afford things even feeling alright.
