---2024-08-01 22:03:40.688001---today was all right i'm anxious about my job it seems i've been talking shit about co-workers which i don't quite understand and i've been fucking up at work. Their all small things but im worried they add up and the longer i stay their the more worried i am that it reflects poorly on me. its hard to judge though because i fix a lot of mistakes around me from veterns, and i cant tell whether what i am doing is minor or major. i'm not sure what the future holds for me i can't tell whether i'm doing good at my job or if this is par for the course. no one will tell me whether i'm doing a good job they all just told me i'm all right. there is no way to gauge my path. i don't know where the line is. i'm worried what tomorrow holds for me.
